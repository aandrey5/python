On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is enabled. 
Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated into '\n' 
before being returned to the caller. If it is '', universal newlines mode is enabled, 
but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. 
If it has any of the other legal values, 
input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
